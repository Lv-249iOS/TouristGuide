# TouristGuide
iTourist (mutual project) – while working on this application we’ve gained a great amount of new knowledge. The main goal was to develop a tourist guide application, that provides information about location, interesting places and weather. Application gives user a lot of useful opportunities. Some of this functions are very special and user can feel the full power of this stuff. For example, client can check the weather for today and six days ahead. Also, application gives the ability to build the route between numerous of places, during the navigation. So, when one point will be reached, our program shows you the shortest way to next destination. Moreover, application can save user`s featured places, and it allows user to share his or her favourite places with friends by the post in social network. Of course, our program has profile and settings. Profile provides all information about user and determines his or her, when comment is left for any place. The last but not the least, settings. It is necessary, because very often users want to customize some stuff, so let's give them what they want.
